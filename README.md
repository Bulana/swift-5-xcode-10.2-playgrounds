This is where I will record my lessons/mistakes I make/pickup while practicing and reminding myself of the swift concepts from Playgrounds. 

Each chapter's lessons, key points and oh aha moments as well as mistakes I will be discussed. 

The branches will be named according to the topic covered. I commit to this to at least 2 hours a day.
